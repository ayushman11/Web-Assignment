Three tabs have been created for News catering to India, Business and Technology.\
The nav-bar has been fixed to the top for effective scrolling.\
Scale of news box transitions on hovering.\
ngx loading bar is added on top to create loading effect.\
Each news piece consists of:\
a) Image\
b) Title/Headline\
c) Description\
d) Content (which could be viwed on source page by clicking on Read More)\
The site is Responsive in nature which could be checked using Inspect Element on the webpage.\

The API calls could be reduced effectively through the following mechanism:\
Whenever a fresh API call is made, it's not neccessary that all new news item are fetched. Therefore,\
on every call, only those item are fetched (possibly none) that are different than the recent content\
received by the previous call.\

Further additions in mind that couldn't be added :\
a)Adding an Interactive world map to switch to news related to any country.\
b) Dark/Light mode\
c) Search Bar in right-hand-side of nav-bar\
d) Increasing article limit to either introduce next page or continuous scrolling with fresh API call after certain Y-Scroll.\
