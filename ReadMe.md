The API calls could be reduced effectively through the following mechanism:\
Whenever a fresh API call is made, it's not neccessary that all new news item are fetched. Therefore,\
on every call, only those item are fetched (possibly none) that are different than the recent content\
received by the previous call.\

a)Adding an Interactive world map to switch to news related to any country.\
